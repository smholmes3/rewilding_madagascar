/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/opensoundscape/ml/cnn.py:599: UserWarning: 
                    This architecture is not listed in opensoundscape.ml.cnn_architectures.ARCH_DICT.
                    It will not be available for loading after saving the model with .save() (unless using pickle=True). 
                    To make it re-loadable, define a function that generates the architecture from arguments: (n_classes, n_channels) 
                    then use opensoundscape.ml.cnn_architectures.register_architecture() to register the generating function.

                    The function can also set the returned object's .constructor_name to the registered string key in ARCH_DICT
                    to avoid this warning and ensure it is reloaded correctly by opensoundscape.ml.load_model().

                    See opensoundscape.ml.cnn_architectures module for examples of constructor functions
